Simple nemo actions scripts.

Available actions:

- Print


## Print

The print action allows to select folders and files and print all supported (printable) documents. Folders will be searched recursively for printable documents (e.g. pdf, jpg, ...). Before printing, two dialogs will be shown. The first dialog allows to select a specific printer and the default system printer will be pre-selected. The second dialog will present a list off all selected or found files. This can be handy especially when only folders have been selected. A user can then decide if all files or only a specific subset of printable files should be sent to a printer.
